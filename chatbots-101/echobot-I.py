Chitchat
Now you're going to leave the simple EchoBot behind and create a bot which can answer simple questions such as "What's your name?" and "What's today's weather?"

You'll use a dictionary with these questions as keys and the correct responses as values.

This means the bot will only respond correctly if the message matches exactly, which is a big limitation. In later exercises you will create much more robust solutions.

The send_message() function has already been defined for you, as well as the bot_template and user_template variables.
